# Single phase feeders  

This repository runs the single-phase Z-Bus on three IEEE distribution test networks. 

The folder ``Constructed-Mat-Files" includes the bus admittance matrix of the three networks.  A typical test run is given by the "test_run" script. If you are interested in using this material in your research, we kindly request you to cite the following publications:
